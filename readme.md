- Auth id you will get from the Blynk app via Mail
- For all the servo you should define virtual pins in the script according to usage and attach to D0-D4 port accordingly.

<br /> 1.Gripper value - 90(release) to 20(grip)
<br /> 2.Reverse / forward - 90 to 170
<br /> 3.down / up - 90 to 180
<br /> 4.right/left - 0 to 180
<br /> all these pins are 'Virtual pins' in the old blynk app.(V0, V1, V2, V3).
<br /> i have used droidcam app to convert another smartphone as remote cam and that will give an stream link that you need to put in the blynk app. select video stream in the blynk app and paste the stream link of droid cam so when both BLYNK app and remote web cam are connected then we will be able to see the live video feed
